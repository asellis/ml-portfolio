# Machine Learning Datasets & Models - Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my machine learning projects and demonstrating my skills in data analysis, model building, and evaluation. It contains a variety of datasets and corresponding machine learning models that Iâ€™ve trained to solve different problems. The goal is to provide a practical demonstration of my abilities for potential employers or collaborators.
